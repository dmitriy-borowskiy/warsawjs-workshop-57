              <strong>Scrambled tofu</strong>

            <p>
              Tofu scramble is a popular quick and easy alternative to scrambled
              eggs. It's <em>fun and simple</em> enough to make at home with
              little more than tofu, a few veggies, and some seasonings.

              <strong>Gua bao</strong>

            <p>
              <em>Also known as the bao bun</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              It consists of filling and condiments sandwiched between flat
              steamed bread known as lotus leaf bread. The lotus leaf bun is
              typically 6â€“8 centimetres in size, semi-circular and flat in form,
              with a horizontal fold that, when opened, gives the appearance
              that it has been sliced.
